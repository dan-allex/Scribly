# Scribly

Social Media platform made with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) where users create sketches using a built-in drawing canvas, and users can view and vote on other people's sketches.

Uses HTML5 Canvas to allow users to draw their sketches on the site to then be published and viewable by other users. Saves state of made drawings to allow for editing of already posted sketches.
